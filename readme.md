#SEC-EDGAR-DWNLD or SED

Use the scripts here to download documents (currently only 10-Ks) off of the SEC's EDGAR database automatically en-masse

In order to automatically 'drive' your webbrowser, you'll need to download chromedriver (chrome), geckodriver (firefox), or another similar software

This database downloader was written on top of the selenium package in python.

If you run into trouble using this, shoot me a message. I probably ran into a similar problem writing this.
